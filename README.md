# Celeste Handheld

Still under development

This project was made to emulate PICO-8 Celeste on a handheld device. Initially, the project was developed\
on a tm4c, but we decided it would be more cost-effective to build it on a different chip. Thus, we chose the\
SAMD21E17 because it met our requirements and was extremely. Furthemore, its built in DAC eliminated the \
need for a physical DAC.

Restart with mplab since integration with vscode was and is pain
